# RESTful-Routes Web Application
## Description

As a cohort of General Assembly SEI-73, we were given the task of creating a web application and deploying it through Heroku. 

The requirements of this app were that it should have full CRUD functionality using the MEN (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) application stack and also that we had to implement OAuth authorisation to protect certain routes in the project.

## Deployment link


## Getting Started/Code Installation

Fork and clone this repo if you want to take a deeper look into the code.

You can also access the files through GitHub in my repository.

## Timeframe & Working Team (Solo/Pair/Group)

We were asked to work individually on this project and given four days on Project Week to complete the assigned task.

## Technologies Used

**Back End**
- MongoDB & Mongoose - database usage for the application
- Express - creating a skeleton app using Express Generator and implementing EJS into the project
- Node.js - running the app outside the browser

**Front End**
- EJS - embedded JavaScript into the HTML
- CSS - for styling the application
- Bootstrap - additional styling for the application
- HTML - to display information on pages

**Development Tools**
- VS Code - to write code and add features
- Chrome Dev Tools - to debug and help figure out routes, cookies etc.
- Google Developers Console - for Authentication and API usage
- Terminal/Command Line - creation of folders/files and downloading of packages needed for the project


## Brief

See below the brief given my my instructional team:

Your App Must:

☐ Have at least 2 data entities (data resources) in addition to the User Model - one entity that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a One:Many or Many:Many relationship with that main entity (embedded or referenced).

☐ Use OAuth authentication.

☐ Implement basic authorization that restricts access to features that need a logged in user in order to work (typically CUD data operations) by "protecting" those routes from anonymous users using the ensureLoggedIn middleware from the OAuth lesson. In addition, ensure that editing and deletion of a data resource can only be done by the user that created that data (this is done in the controller - refer to the Guide to User-Centric CRUD).

☐ Have full-CRUD data operations somewhere within the app's features. For example, you can have functionality that Creates & Updates a post and satisfy Delete functionality by implementing the ability to delete comments.

☐ Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - in other words, it should have a consistent and polished user interface.

☐ Be deployed online (Heroku).

Optionally, Your App May:

☐ Consume a third-party API. If you choose to implement this option, it's likely that the data from the API will be a key data resource in your app, therefore it's important to consider how to implement whatever CRUD data operations will apply. For example, when will data from the API find its way into your database? Be sure to discuss with an instructor when planning your app's features.

☐ Expose its own API where it returns data resources as JSON.



Necessary Deliverables

☐ A working full-stack app that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on Heroku.

A README.md file with these sections (here's a basic template):☐ App Title: Contains a description of what the app does and optional background info.☐ Screenshot(s): A screenshot of your app's landing page and any other screenshots of interest.☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used.☐ Getting Started: Include a link to the deployed app and your Trello board with the project's planning.☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

## Planning

Instructions

The planning stage is important, as all projects in your future roles will have detailed plans before any coding happens. It is a great experience to share with potential engineer employers, as this reflects real engineering team practices. 

Start by explaining the initial steps you took in the project. 

Did you do any sketches? If so, discuss this and include images.
Any wireframes of the front end and UI? You did? Then explain this and include images.
Any ERDs? Same here, explain and include images.
Use a project management tool to plan the sprint? If so, talk through this - what tool did you use? How you allocated tickets/responsibilities, sprint timeline etc. Also include screenshots of this.
Any pseudocode? 
If it was a group or pair project - Discuss who was designated which tasks. This is very important, as engineers want to understand who owned the different code elements when looking at a group project.

For each project, review the above bullets and discuss every step you took in the planning stage, including the relevant images.

Not every project will include the above, but it’s important to discuss any of the bullets that you did implement.

For the majority of the planning stage, I used a Trello Board with all of the instructions/information I would need to create the project, including Wireframes (created through https://excalidraw.com/) and an ERD to guide me through the MVC stage of my project.

Find below a screenshot of an example of one of my wireframes:

To create my ERD, I used the website: https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/

## Build/Code Process

Instructions

The Build/Code Process will be the longest section of your ReadMe and will be most insightful to the engineers that review them. This is where you will discuss the steps you took to code the project.

You want to see your ReadMes as a way to walk the engineers through your approach and problem solving from the start of the project through to the end.

You'll need to include a minimum of 3-4 code snippets, highlighting code you're particularly proud of and these code snippets will have descriptions on what you did, how and why to set the context of the snippet you include. These explanations are important for the engineers, as they will want to understand what you did and the reasoning behind the steps you took.

You don't need to document every single thing you coded, but walk them through the key sections of the project build.

For any group project, you will just focus on your contributions. 

Some people will document the build/code process by discussing the key stages they worked on. Others will do a day by day guide. It’s entirely up to you how you structure this, as long as you discuss all the key things above.

## Challenges

Instructions

Challenges are great for showing your learning journey and problem solving, and this is a section that many engineers will check out. Every day of your engineering career you’ll encounter challenges, this is part of your growth and development. It’s the challenges you encounter that helps you become a stronger and more competent engineer. 

Here you will detail any particular challenges you encountered as you were coding the project. 

Questions to answer here:

What technical challenges did you come across? 
Why were these challenges? 
What problem solving did you do to rectify them?
Team dynamics/ Project management
Tools/Tech you used

Insert your Challenges here:




## Wins

Instructions

The Wins section is your opportunity to highlight the aspects of your project you are most proud of. See this as your chance to showcase these parts of your projects to the engineers reading your ReadMes.

Things you could discuss here:

Interesting problem solving you did
Strong sections of code
Collaboration with other team members
Visual design of the project

## Key Learnings/Takeaways

Instructions

This section is one of the other most important parts of your ReadMe from an engineers’ perspective and helps to differentiate each of you from your classmates and team members. 

Engineers love to understand what you learn from each project and how it has shaped you as an engineer. 

See this as your opportunity to show the engineers how your skills grew during each project sprint. 

Things you could discuss here:

What Technologies/Tools do you now feel more confident with? Tell them specifically what you learnt about these. 
What engineering processes did you become more comfortable with? Standups? Pair programming? Project management? Tell them what you learnt from these processes?

Insert your Key Learnings/Takeaways here:





## Bugs

Instructions

If you have any bugs in your project, it’s important that you flag them in your ReadMe. This helps the engineers reviewing your projects to understand that you are aware that there are issues - if you don’t flag these, then they won’t have that visibility that you know these problems are in your code and it can result in them not having a full understanding of your technical knowledge. 

In either sentences or bullets, explain what the bugs are.

If you have no bugs, you can leave this section blank.

Insert your Bugs here:



## Future Improvements

Instructions

It’s common to get to the end of your project and have ideas on what you would do if you have more time, as well as how you might improve it. 

If you do, you should detail this here. It’s great to give that context on potential future improvements, to share your creative or technical ideas with the engineers reading your ReadMes.

In either sentences or bullets, explain what your future improvements would be.
